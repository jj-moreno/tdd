<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Write a simple console application focusing highly on approach and correctness.
* Put everything I have learned so far in OOP, OOD, SOLID principles and TDD.
* Will need to use a testing framework like JUnit5 or TestNG.
* Assignment describes to build an application that prints out receipt details for various shopping baskets.
* Keep in mind to adhere to all business requirements.
*

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* I've built several console applications so no issue here but this time we should focus on code quality.
* I will approach this problem with a TDD approach. TDD is new to me so I must make sure each step I'm sticking to TDD.
* I believe that as I implement the solution I will find opportunities to refactor parts of my solution to improve code quality.
* I will go with JUnit5 as my testing framework. This framework is chosen since it is the one taught to me. 
* I will jot down all the business requirements and write tests for each one failing first, passing second, and refactoring last.
* 
*

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Started IntelliJ and will import as Java project to have a proper src folder and I will now setup my project with test directory and JUnit5.
* After I will build out the skeleton of my application and write my first test, making sure that it fails first.
